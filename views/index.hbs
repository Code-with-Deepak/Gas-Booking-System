                    <p>LPG is a colourless gas. LPG is not poisonous. However, at the time of production,mercaptan (a chemical compound) is added to it so as to give the now familiar foul smell for easy detection of gas in the air.
                    Even very small quantities of gas can be detected by this smell.</p>
                    <h3>Safety</h3><hr>
                    <p>Since LPG is almost twice the weight of air it tends to settle down at floor level, particularly in depressions. Hence, care has to be taken in placing the gas installations in the house. Also the fact that 1 cc. of liquid LPG multiplies into about 270 cc. of gaseous LPG helps it spread very rapidly in the atmosphere. Hence, if a gas cylinder leaks, it should be immediately removed to an open area.
